    <h1>Safelop — Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 28, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Safelop is an iOS application for securely storing passwords, credentials, and sensitive data. Your privacy is our top priority. This policy explains how Safelop handles your data.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Safelop does <strong>not</strong> collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers controlled by the developer. The app operates entirely on your device with optional iCloud sync.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All your passwords and credentials are stored locally on your device using iOS Keychain and encrypted Core Data. If you enable iCloud sync, your data is synced via Apple's CloudKit, which is end-to-end encrypted and controlled by your Apple ID.</p>

    <h2>iCloud Sync</h2>
    <p>When enabled, Safelop uses Apple CloudKit to sync your data across your Apple devices. This data is encrypted and stored in your private iCloud container. The developer has no access to your CloudKit data.</p>

    <h2>Analytics & Tracking</h2>
    <p>Safelop does <strong>not</strong> include any analytics, tracking, or telemetry. No third-party SDKs are embedded. No usage data is collected.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Safelop does not integrate with any third-party services. All functionality is provided natively through Apple frameworks.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Safelop does not knowingly collect data from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated date.</p>
